## Adding customized memes
By default, the workflow comes with some popular memes, but if you want, you can
add yours just creating a `.memes` file at your home folder with the following
format:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Guarana tutle",
    "image": "http://i.imgur.com/yYgDYHy.png"
  },
  {
    "title": "Magical unicorn",
    "image": "http://i.imgur.com/3eluNZ5.jpg"
  },
  {
    "title": "Bear thief",
    "image": "http://i.imgur.com/ZvZYNFP.gif"
  }
]
```

## Listing all memes
Typing `meme` will return all memes:
